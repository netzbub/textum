*Weave your Apple / iCloud Contacts — and the relationships between them — into Obsidian
as clean, queryable Markdown.*

> **The name.** *textum* (Latin) — a woven fabric; also: a text. The plugin weaves your
> contacts and the relationships already in your address book into one connected, textual
> graph inside Obsidian.

Sync macOS / iCloud Contacts into Obsidian as clean, well-structured Markdown notes —
and turn the **relationships** that already live in your address book (family, project
teams, company membership) into data you can query, chart and visualise inside Obsidian.

The frontmatter is deliberately aligned with **[Charted Roots](https://github.com/banisterious/obsidian-charted-roots)**,
the genealogy/relationship plugin textum targets first (see
[Orientation toward Charted Roots](#orientation-toward-charted-roots)).

## Purpose

`Apple Contacts.app` is an excellent place to *store* contact data but a poor place to
*analyse* it. Years — sometimes a decade — of carefully maintained names, addresses,
dates, photos, group memberships and **related names** sit in a flat store with no query
language, no joins, no graph.

This extension extracts that data into one Markdown note per contact with a clean YAML
frontmatter, so it can be used and cross-analysed in Obsidian with extensions like
**Charted Roots**, **Relations**, **Breadcrumbs**, **Bases**, **Dataview** and others.

Typical uses:

- **Family / genealogy** — render family trees and pedigrees from the *related names*
  you already maintain. Apple's standard kinship labels (Mother, Father, Brother, Sister,
  Son, Daughter, Spouse) become typed, gendered frontmatter keys
  (`father`, `mother`, `brother`, `sister`, `children`, `spouse`) that map straight onto
  Charted Roots' tree fields.
- **Project teams** — link every contact assigned to a building project, see all
  participants of ***"Project renovation city hall"***, filter by trade (carpenter,
  bricklayer, etc.): who is on which project, which trades are covered, who rated
  "recommended".
- **Company / org membership** — who belongs to which firm or department.
- **Map** — plot contact addresses on a map (requires a geocoding step, see *Usage*).

## What this fork adds (vs. Truls Aagaard's original)

The original syncs contacts faithfully but flattens several things that this fork now
makes **structured and analysable**. Status per item (all implemented):

| # | Improvement | Why it matters ("leverage") | Status |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | **Write group membership** as a `groups:` property per contact | The original already *fetches* iCloud group cards (CardDAV `X-ADDRESSBOOKSERVER-KIND:group`) but only uses them to *filter* which contacts to sync. Writing membership exposes your entire group taxonomy as a queryable property. | done |
| 2 | **Write addresses as a flat, readable list** under `addresses:` | The original joins `ADR` into one raw string and could render it as a JSON-looking array. This fork writes one human-readable line per address (optional label + street, postcode + city, state, country), e.g. `Privat: Vogelsangstr. 27, 70176 Stuttgart, Deutschland`. | done |
| 3 | **Un-escape notes** (`\n`, `\,` → real newline/comma) | The original leaks vCard escaping into the note text. | done |
| 4 | **Typed, gendered relationship keys** (`father`, `mother`, `spouse`, `children`, `brother`, `sister`, `cousin` / `cousine`, …) | The original puts all related names into one `related names` list. Splitting into typed keys is what lets genealogy/relationship plugins draw family trees. The keys match **Charted Roots'** tree fields directly (`father` / `mother` / `spouse` / `children`); side relatives map onto Charted Roots custom relationship types. Charted Roots reconstructs the reverse direction of family edges itself, so each relationship only needs to be recorded once. | done |
| 5 | **Localisation layer** (`relationship_locales.json`) | English canonical relationship keys + per-language label maps, so the tool works for non-German/English address books. | done |
| 6 | **Filesystem-safe filenames + name-based linking** | Sanitises only the characters that are unsafe on file systems / WebDAV (slash, colon, asterisk, quote, angle brackets, pipe, hash, leading/trailing whitespace, trailing dots), keeps spaces and umlauts, and normalises to Unicode NFC (avoids macOS ↔ Nextcloud mismatches). Relationships resolve against the `name` frontmatter / alias, not the raw filename — so sanitising a name never breaks a link. | done |

"Leverage" = biggest benefit per unit of effort. #1 and #4 unlock the most (groups +
genealogy visualisation); #2 makes addresses both readable and map-ready; #3 fixes
readability.

## Complete list of fields and how to use them

Mapping from Apple Contacts field → recommended use → Obsidian frontmatter key.
**Rule of thumb:** *Person ↔ person → Related name. Categories → Groups. Role → Job title.
Free text → Notes (with the `---` convention below).*

| Apple field | vCard | Recommended use | Frontmatter key | Multi |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| First/Last/  Prefix/Suffix | N / FN | Name, note title | `name` / file name | – |
| Nickname | NICKNAME | Nickname | `nickname` | – |
| Company | ORG | Organisation | `organization` | – |
| Department | – | Sub-grouping | `department` | – |
| **Job title** | TITLE | **Role / trade (Gewerk) of a person** | `role` | – |
| Phone | TEL | Contact | `telephone` | yes |
| Email | EMAIL | Contact | `email` | yes |
| Homepage | URL | Web | `url` | yes |
| **Address** | ADR | **Location → map (after geocoding)** | `addresses` (flat list) | yes |
| Birthday | BDAY | Life dates | `birthday` | – |
| Date (custom) | X-ABDATE + label | **Death date**, anniversary, events | `death` / `date` | yes |
| **Related name** | X-ABRELATEDNAMES + label | **Genealogy + person relations** | `father` / `mother` / `spouse` / `children` / `brother` / `sister` / … | yes |
| Social profile | X-SOCIALPROFILE | Social | `social profile` | yes |
| Instant message | IMPP | Messaging | `instant message` | yes |
| **Notes** | NOTE | **Tag block + prose** (see below) | `tags` + body | – |
| **Groups** | group card | **Project / trade / rating / district / selection** | `groups` | yes |

---

## Prerequisites

- macOS (tested on macOS 15.7.5)
- macOS Contacts (tested on v14.0)
- Obsidian (tested on v1.12.7)
- An iCloud **app-specific password** (or a Nextcloud address-book share URL)

---

## Installation

Not yet in the community store. Two ways to install:

### Option A — BRAT (recommended)

1. Install **BRAT** (Settings → Community plugins → Browse → "BRAT").
2. BRAT → **Add beta plugin** → paste: `netzbub/textum`
3. Confirm. BRAT installs **textum** from the latest release and keeps it updated.
4. Enable **textum** under *Settings → Community plugins*.

### Option B — manual

1. Build: `npm install` then `npm run build` → produces `main.js`.
2. Copy `main.js` and `manifest.json` into
   `<your-vault>/.obsidian/plugins/textum/`.
3. Enable the plugin under *Settings → Community plugins*.

(For development: `npm run dev` for a watching build; `npm test` runs the Jest suite.)

---

## Configuration (plugin settings)

- **iCloud username** — your iCloud email.
- **iCloud app-specific password** — generate at
  [support.apple.com/102654](https://support.apple.com/en-us/102654).
- **iCloud server URL** — default `https://contacts.icloud.com`
  (China: `https://contacts.icloud.com.cn`; Nextcloud: the address-book share URL).
- **Contacts folder** — vault folder for the notes (default `Contacts`).
- **Labels toggles** — add labels to phone / email / url / related names / addresses.
- **Write Charted Roots keys** — write `cr_type` (`person`, or `organization` for Apple
  "Company" cards) and a stable `cr_id` (the Apple UID) to every contact, so the notes are
  recognised by the Charted Roots plugin. On by default; turn off if you don't use Charted
  Roots.
- **Excluded keys** — space-delimited keys not written to frontmatter (raw data stays in
  `iCloudVCard`).
- **Groups** — select which iCloud groups to sync, with a **Select all groups** master
  toggle.

## Usage

### A) Prepare the data in Apple Contacts

This is where the value is created.  
Conventions:

- **Person ↔ person relationships** (genealogy): use **Related name** with labels
  (Mother, Father, Brother, Sister, Son, Daughter, Spouse, and custom labels such as
  Uncle, Grandfather, Cousin). The value (=**first name & family name**) must **exactly
  match** the other contact's display name — resolution is by name. textum turns these
  labels into typed, gendered frontmatter keys: Mother → `mother`, Father → `father`,
  Brother → `brother`, Sister → `sister`, Son/Daughter → `children`, Spouse → `spouse`;
  side relatives keep their own keys (`cousin`, `cousine`, `uncle`, `aunt`, `nephew`,
  `niece`, `grandfather`, `grandmother`).  
  As soon as the localisation is finished, it will be possible to use the localized
  expressions in Contacts.app for the following languages:  
  **Ready:** English · German  
  **Planned:** French · Spanish · Italian · Portuguese · Dutch · Danish · Norwegian ·
  Swedish · Finnish · Russian · Ukrainian · Polish · Turkish · Japanese ·
  Chinese (Mandarin) · Korean · Hindi · Arabic
- **Categories** (project, trade/Gewerk, rating, district, selection): use **Groups**.
- **Role / trade of a person**: use the **Job title** field.
- **Free text + structured tags in Notes** — use a delimiter convention so the note stays
  parseable:

  ```
  Doctors, ENT
  ---
  Opening hours Mon–Thu 8–17:00, Fri 8–12:00
  ```

  Everything **above** the `---` line is treated as comma- or line-separated **tags**
  (here → `Doctors`, `ENT`); everything **below** stays as free note body. Pick one style
  (comma *or* one entry per line) and keep it consistent.

> Apple Contacts cannot create arbitrary new field types — only custom *labels* on
> existing types. That is why categorical data goes into Groups, not invented fields.

### B) Sync into Obsidian

Run the command **"Update Contacts"** (only changed contacts) or **"Update all
Contacts"** (rewrites everything — use after changing settings/excluded keys).

The plugin only manages a fixed set of keys plus the title and the top H1. **Anything
else you write in a note — and any extra frontmatter keys you add yourself (e.g.
`rating:`, `lat:`, `lng:`) — is preserved across
syncs.** Sync is one-way (iCloud → Obsidian) by design: edits or corruption in Obsidian
can never flow back to your address book.

### C) Analyse / visualise in Obsidian

The primary target is **Charted Roots** (see the next section for the field mapping and
the one-time setup). Other plugins consume the same frontmatter:

| Purpose | Extension | Output |
|---|---|---|
| Family trees, pedigrees, organisation hierarchies, GEDCOM round-trip | **Charted Roots** | family/pedigree charts, canvas trees, maps, reports |
| Family trees, pedigrees, relationship graphs | **Relations** | family graph |
| Hierarchy navigation, project/org trees | **Breadcrumbs** (typed links) | tree / matrix / Mermaid / Markmap / Canvas |
| Tables, cards, **map** of contacts | **Bases** (core) | table / card / map view |
| Ad-hoc queries (e.g. birthdays today, phone list of linked contacts) | **Dataview** | tables / lists |
| Address pins (after geocoding) | **Map View** / Leaflet | interactive map |

Example — Dataview list of contacts linked in the current note:

````markdown
```dataview
TABLE email, telephone
FROM outgoing([[#]])
WHERE iCloudVCard
```
````

**Map:** addresses need geocoding (address string → `lat`/`lng`) before plotting — a
one-time batch step (Nominatim/OSM with rate limits, or a paid geocoder) that writes
coordinates into the notes. Then Bases map view or Map View renders them.

## Orientation toward Charted Roots

textum's frontmatter was not designed in isolation. Before settling the field schema, the
existing Obsidian genealogy/relationship ecosystem was surveyed to see what a mature target
looks like. Among the available tools,
**[Charted Roots](https://github.com/banisterious/obsidian-charted-roots)** stood out as the
most advanced and the most actively developed: beyond family trees it models places,
sources, events and **organisational hierarchies** as first-class entity types (with its own
`organization` notes and membership arrays), and the repository is under active development.
On that basis textum's output keys were aligned with the properties Charted Roots reads, so
that contacts maintained in Apple Contacts feed a forward-looking target without manual
reshaping.

This is an alignment, not an affiliation: textum is independent and not endorsed by the
Charted Roots project.

**Field mapping — textum → Charted Roots:**

| textum frontmatter | Charted Roots property | Role in Charted Roots |
|---|---|---|
| note title / `name` | `name` | person node |
| `cr_type` (`person` / `organization`) | `cr_type` | note-type detection — written automatically (see below) |
| `cr_id` (Apple UID) | `cr_id` | stable unique id — written automatically |
| `father` | `father` | parent edge (drawn in the tree) |
| `mother` | `mother` | parent edge (drawn in the tree) |
| `spouse` | `spouse` | spouse edge (drawn in the tree) |
| `children` | `children` | child edge (drawn in the tree) |
| `brother` / `sister` | custom relationship type | shown in Entity Profile; siblings are otherwise derived from shared parents |
| `cousin` / `cousine`, `uncle`, `aunt`, `nephew`, `niece`, `grandfather`, `grandmother` | custom relationship types | shown in Entity Profile (not drawn in the tree) |
| `birthday` | `born` (via property alias) | birth date |
| `death` | `died` (via property alias) | death date |
| `organization` (plain text from Apple ORG) | — | mapping to Charted Roots' `organization` notes / `membership_*` arrays is manual for now (see *Organisation hierarchies are Phase 2*, below) |

Charted Roots stores family links as a wikilink plus an optional `<field>_id`; the bare
wikilink textum writes is sufficient, and Charted Roots reconstructs the reverse direction
of each family edge itself.

**One-time Charted Roots configuration** (in the Charted Roots vault, not in textum):

1. **Property aliases** — *Settings → Charted Roots → Property & value aliases*: map
   `birthday` → `born` and `death` → `died`.
2. **Custom relationship types** — define `brother`, `sister`, `cousin`, `cousine`,
   `uncle`, `aunt`, `nephew`, `niece`, `grandfather`, `grandmother` so they render with a
   label/line style in the Entity Profile.

**Note-type detection.** Charted Roots only treats a note as a person when it carries
`cr_type: person` (companies use `cr_type: organization`; the legacy `type:` or a
`#person` tag also work). textum writes `cr_type` and a stable `cr_id` (the Apple UID)
automatically — controlled by the *Write Charted Roots keys* setting, on by default. Apple
"Company" cards (`X-ABShowAs:COMPANY`) are written as `organization`, everyone else as
`person`. Disable the setting if you don't use Charted Roots. Toggling this setting counts
as a settings change, so the next *Update Contacts* run rewrites every note to add (or
remove) the keys.

**Organisation *hierarchies* are Phase 2.** Company cards are marked `cr_type:
organization`, but Apple only provides the firm as a plain text string (`ORG`, written to
`organization`). Charted Roots' richer organisation model — `parent_org`,
`membership_orgs` / `membership_roles`, seats, roles — is not populated; linking people to
firms and building org hierarchies from the flat ORG text is left for a later iteration.

---

## Localisation

Relationship type names are **English canonical** (`father`, `mother`, `brother`,
`sister`, `children`, `spouse`, `cousin`, `grandfather`, …). Apple's standard relationship
labels are already stored as English tokens internally (`_$!<Mother>!$_`), so only
**custom labels** (in the user's language) need a per-language map in
`relationship_locales.json` (`label_map_source_to_canonical`).

Adding a language = adding ~20–40 kinship terms → canonical keys. Mechanically cheap.
Linguistically, languages with finer kinship systems (Chinese, Japanese, Arabic, Hindi)
distinguish e.g. paternal vs. maternal uncle; map several source terms onto one canonical
key (lossy) or extend the canonical keys (`uncle_paternal`, `uncle_maternal`).

Widely spoken languages worth supporting: English, Mandarin Chinese, Hindi, Spanish,
French, Arabic, Portuguese, Russian, Japanese, plus Italian, Korean, Turkish, Dutch,
Polish.

### A note on languages with richer kinship systems

Several of the planned languages — **Chinese, Japanese, Korean, Arabic and Hindi** — encode
kinship distinctions that English and German simply collapse. Where English has a single
word *uncle*, these languages mark the **father's vs. the mother's side**, and often the
**relative age** of the linked relative: Mandarin separates 伯 (father's elder brother),
叔 (father's younger brother) and 舅 (mother's brother); Arabic distinguishes عم (paternal
uncle) from خال (maternal uncle); Hindi has चाचा / ताऊ versus मामा. Siblings are split by
seniority in Chinese, Japanese and Korean (e.g. 哥 *elder* vs. 弟 *younger* brother; 兄 vs.
弟), and Korean terms additionally depend on the **speaker's own gender** (a male says 형
for an older brother, a female says 오빠).

Because these distinctions have no one-to-one equivalent among the English canonical keys,
the localisation resolves them in one of two ways, configurable per language:

- **Collapse (default).** Every source term is mapped to the nearest canonical key — 伯, 叔
  and 舅 all become `uncle`. This keeps relationship graphs consistent and comparable
  across languages. The nuance is **not lost silently**: the original label is preserved on
  the link (as its display alias / `relation_label`), so it stays visible in the note even
  though the structural key is generic.
- **Extended keys (opt-in).** Finer canonical keys such as `uncle_paternal` /
  `uncle_maternal` or `brother_elder` / `brother_younger` can be enabled, preserving the
  distinction as structured data. Note that the family-tree visualisers build their layout
  only from the structural core (`father`, `mother`, `spouse`, `children`); extended
  kinship keys therefore act as descriptive metadata and do not change the shape of the
  tree.

The default is *collapse*, because it yields clean, comparable graphs and never discards
information (the original term is retained as a label). Speakers of these languages who
want full fidelity can switch on the extended keys for their locale.
